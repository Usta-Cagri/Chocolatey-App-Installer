## About the Creator

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m an amateur developer with limited experience in scripting and coding. This project is one of my first attempts at creating something useful for others. Since I have a busy schedule, I might not be able to update or improve this script regularly.  

However, Iâ€™m very open to feedback, suggestions, and contributions! If you find any bugs or have ideas for improvements, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. Your support means a lot! ðŸ˜Š

## How to Use
1. You can easily type: 
```Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Usta-Cagri/Chocolatey-App-Installer/main/CAI-Starter.ps1 | iex ```
on an elevated powershell window if you've installed chocolatey package manager but soon this script will automate that. (This is the recommended way because it doesn't install anything to your disk and if you have a bit of terminal knowledge you can add this to you $PROFILE folder) 
2. Just pick a number and follow the instructions.

##Info About the Predefined Lists
-**Install predefined apps** function installs VS-Codium,(which is vscode but open-source) Firefox and Onlyoffice.
-**Install gaming stuff** function installs Steam, EA-App, Ubisoft Connect, Heroic-Games-Launcher(a better alternative for Epic Games Launcher and GOG you don't have to buy the games if you own them since it uses your Epic Games or GOG account and personally I think it is a better launcher) and MSI Afterburner.
